Hybrid mobile application using Ionic framework

# app description
A voluntary project, it connects medicine donners with a central hub to be distributed again after some classifications.
I’m currently working on it, I’m listing it here for two reasons: it’s my first deal with mobile applications, and it’s a project which I’m trying to apply best practises on it.
